## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Showing summary of IRIS data 
```{r cars}
summary(iris)
```

## Scatter Plot on IRIS data for sepal length & width where species are colored

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

plot(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length, data=iris,col=c("red","blue","green")[as.integer(Species)],pch=c(1,2,3)[as.integer(Species)], main= "IRIS Data Sepal Length & Width of Species")

legend(x="topleft",
       legend=c("setosa","versicolor","virginica"),
       col=c("red","blue","green"),pch=c(1,2,3))
```
